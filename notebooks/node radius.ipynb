    "\n",
    "Let's look at this [Lausanne map](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search.php?q=lausanne&polygon=1&viewbox=) for example. As we can see, it's difficult to find a general shape of Lausanne's borders.\n",
    "Furthermore, we have to keep in mind that our ultimate goal is not to exaclty locate tweets in their respective cities, but more to associate each tweet with a global node of Switzerland. In this case, we would like to associate tweets from Renens or Ecublens to the Lausanne node. But this is not possible using this technique given these cities are obviously out of the bounds."

    "One way could be to take the furthermost point of the boundary from the center, and take this distance as a radius for the node.\n",

This time we see that the boundaries are pretty circular, which is convenient. But if we use this tecnique, we will find ourselves taking into account the city of Gevena only, ommitting the around cities that could bring a lot of potential tweets for the same node."
