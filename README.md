# Applied Data Analysis Project
## Mobility patterns in Switzerland with Twitter

This project proposal aims to provide a high-level description of the project we plan to realize, by giving information about the data, feasability, risks, deliverables, timeplan and challenging parts.

### Data Description

### Feasability and Risks
#### Feasability

#### Risks
The main risk is to realize that the data doesn't contain any relevant information about what we aim to analyze. This mean that after a deep analysis, we could see that the tweets location doesn't present any relation in order to deduce mobility flows. 

Big data experience ?

### Deliverables

#### First deliverable
**Deadline** : checkpoint.

**Description** : ???.

#### Final deliverable
**Deadline** : end of the project.

**Description** : ???.

### Timeplan

| Date | Task |
|------|------|
| November 6th | Project proposal |
|November 6th - End of November | Getting familiar with data, choosing framworks and tools |
| Beginning of December | First deliverable development |
|Mid December (TBD) | Checkpoint |
|Mid December - January | Final deliverable development |
| End of January (TBD) | Mini-Symposium |

### Challenge

---> Pick one : Viz or Big Data ?

Viz could be cool but lot of time to discover new APIs... not sure to get an acceptable result, and maybe not very useful for out future.

Big data : no experience but, interesting to start working with big data for the future. Also given we are not sure to have enough relevant data, we shouldn't limit our data set, which we will have to do if we choose to not work with big data.
